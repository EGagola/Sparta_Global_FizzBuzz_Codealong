# Sparta_Global_FizzBuzz_Codealong

##Aim
To show best practice for unit testing by writing code out in a structured manner that follows best practices.


## Test Driven Development
Test driven development is the method of writing tests prior to code development, beginning with a test that fails. After this the code is written to pass the test and then is refactored to be as efficient as possible.

For this task, tests were developed for methods that generated a fizzbuzz array, for a sum of multiples of three and five in a given range and for a sum of even numbers in the fibonacci sequence for a given end point.

Modules were also implemented to keep code DRY by putting common methods in a location that is accessible by multiple classes.
